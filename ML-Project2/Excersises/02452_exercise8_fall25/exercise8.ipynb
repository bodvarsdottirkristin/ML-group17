    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We previously studied how models can easily overfit the training data if the model is too flexible. We argued that we can mitigate overfitting, by using larger datasets or simplifying the model, e.g. by reducing the number of parameters in linear models. These strategies apply broadly across modeling techniques. However, collecting more data can be expensive and in some settings we might need a highly flexible model to be able to fit complex data. In this exercise, we will study other approaches to reducing overfitting - specifically, we will consider techniques that *trade off model variance with model bias*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias and variance describe how well a model generalizes beyond its training data:\n",
    "- **Bias** relates to *how well the model fits the training data*. The better it fits this data, the *lower* the bias is. A too simple model (*high bias*) might not fit the data which results in *underfitting*.\n",
    "- **Variance** relates to the *flexibility of the model when we train it on a new data set*. If we train a model on new training sets, their outputs can be very different as the model's parameters have greater variance. This relates to *overfitting*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that we can not prevent under- and overfitting simultaneously is why we call it *the bias–variance trade-off*. Reducing variance usually increases bias, and reducing bias usually increases variance. Therefore we need to find a balance where the model captures real patterns without overfitting to noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, one can combine the predictions of multiple models in an *ensemble*. This can reduce model variance without greatly increasing bias which can give better generalization performance."

    "## Part 1: Regularization for trading of variance with bias\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach to control for the complexity of the model is to regularize the parameters in the objective function. For instance for linear regression we can regularize the parameters $\\boldsymbol{w}$ by the Frobenius norm, which essentially forces the model to be less flexible but with the benefit that it is also less likely to overfit. By regularizing the weights in this manner, the considered cost function is the mean squared error with an additional term, i.e.:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    E\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}, \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{w}\\right) &=\\sum_n \\|y_n -\\boldsymbol{x}_n^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_F^2+\\lambda \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_F^2 =\\sum_n (y_n -\\boldsymbol{x}_n^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{w})^2+\\lambda \\underset{=\\lVert \\boldsymbol{w}\\rVert_2^2}{\\underbrace{\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{w}}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}, \\boldsymbol{y}\\right)$ is the data matrix and target vector. Solving the equation $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{w}}=0$ we obtain $\\boldsymbol{w}=(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\top\\boldsymbol{X}+\\lambda\\boldsymbol{I})^{-1}\\boldsymbol{X}^\\top\\boldsymbol{y}$ (see also the lecture slides for today). This type of regularization is commonly known as *ridge regularization* \n",
    "\n",
    "When regularizing a model as above we apply the same regularization strength to all features, and so it is important to standardize the features. Note that if we include a bias term (offset/intercept) we do not regularize it. In the following, we will see how regularization can help us to avoid overfitting by trading off model variance with bias. For doing so, we revisit the polynomial dataset from week 6."

    "**Answer to 4.1 and 4.10:** While bagging reduces variance by averaging many models, the bias of the ensemble is not decreased when majority voting with many high-bias learners. Hence, using a stronger learner with bagging can be beneficial. Contrarily, boosting directly accounts for mispredictions on the data by reweighting the bootstrap sampling, and thereby seeks to lower the bias. When joining multiple of these weak learners, the variance also decrease. \n",
