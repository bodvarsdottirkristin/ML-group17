    "In this exercise we will take a closer look on ways to load data in Python and explore some of the many data visualization techniques we can apply to better understand the content of a dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a standard data representation throughout this course, by collecting $N$ individual data points $\\boldsymbol{x}_i = \\left[x_1, x_2, \\dots x_M\\right]^\\top$ with $M$ attributes/features in a data matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ of size $N\\times M$. This means that the $i$'th row in $\\boldsymbol{X}$ corresponds to the $i$'th data point, while the $j$'th column contains all observations of the $j$'th attribute. As discussed in the lecture, these attributes can be discrete or continuous and of the types nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the course we will use the data matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ for solving both 1) **predictive tasks** where we aim to predict unknown values of some target attribute and 2) **descriptive tasks** where we aim at finding human-interpretable patterns that describe the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using $\\boldsymbol{X}$ for predictive tasks is what we call **supervised learning** and consists of learning a mapping between the attributes in $\\boldsymbol{X}$ and a **target attribute**. We will here call $\\boldsymbol{X}$ the **input data** and denote the target attribute by $\\boldsymbol{y}=\\left[y_1, y_2, \\dots y_N\\right]^\\top$ such that there is a target value associated to each $i$'th input data point. We can think of supervised learning as finding a function, $f$, such that our predictions $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} = f\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}\\right)$ are \"close\" to the true values in $\\boldsymbol{y}$. If the target attribute is discrete we solve a **classification task** while we solve a **regression task** if the target attribute is continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using $\\boldsymbol{X}$ for descriptive tasks is known as **unsupervised learning** and is used for exploratory analyses of the data. Examples of unsupervised learning techniques are 1) clustering techniques that relates to finding hidden group structures $\\boldsymbol{X}$, 2) **anomaly detection** that considers finding abnormal data points or 3) **representation learning** where we seek some meaningful latent representations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercise, we will get familiar with loading datasets distributed as various types of files into the $\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}, \\boldsymbol{y}\\right)$-format described above. We will generally load data into Pandas dataframes as the Pandas library provides flexible tools for data analysis, except when working with more complex data types as text and images.\n",

    "## Part 1: Loading data in Python - the Iris flower dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the Iris flower dataset (downloaded [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)) - or Fisher's Iris dataset - is a multivariate dataset introduced by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1936) for the problem of classifying Iris flower types.It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris dataset because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the geographic variation of Iris flowers in the Gaspé Peninsula. The dataset consists of $N=50$ samples from each of $C=3$ species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Each observation has $M=4$ attributes measured: the length and the width of sepal and petal, in centimetres, hence $\\boldsymbol{x}_i = (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$. Based on the combination of the four variables, Fisher developed a model to distinguish the species from each other - it is used as a typical test for many other classification techniques (see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)).\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple format of storing data is the comma-separated values-file format (or CSV). In such files, a sample or an observation is a line in a text document and the document then has as many lines (or rows) as there are samples, i.e. $N$. The attribute values for an observation is written within one line, separated by (usually) a comma or a tab-character in a consistent order. This order is usually defined in a header (the first line of the file), which has a designation of the variable name in some format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 1.1:** Inspect the `iris.csv` file from the associated data folder. Load the CSV-file using Pandas and split it into the standard $\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}, \\boldsymbol{y}\\right)$-format. Make sure to keep $\\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\\boldsymbol{y}$ as Pandas data types.\n",
    "> *Hint:* Open the CSV-file using e.g. Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for MacOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Hint:* Use `df = pd.read_csv()` to load the CSV-file into a Pandas dataframe. Then split it into $\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}, \\boldsymbol{y}\\right)$, e.g. using `df.drop()` and `df[target_attr_name]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Hint:* The class label (the flower species) are stored as text (or strings). Convert it into a categorical attribute using `pd.Categorical()`. Type `help(pd.Categorical)` if you get lost."

Argue from the graph why it would be better to use petal length and width rather than sepal length and width.\n",
